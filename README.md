# Reach v1.2
A Job-hunt Assistant App to help reach your dream job!

## Main Features:
* Organize job applications you have submitted
* As the application moves forward (i.e. Interviews, Offers..), keep track of its status to know what to do next

## Future Additions:
* Integrate an API (Glassdoor?) to show more company details (Locations, Ranking, etc)
* More Mobile-Friendliness
* Edit application info within the Dashboard, instead of on another page
* Integrate moment.js to show "X Days Ago" instead of the last updated date
