## To Do before Project Deadline:
* Dashboard
  * Implement "X Days Ago" to replace the updated_at date using [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/)
  * On an application being moved using Action, blink the moved application [Reference](https://jsfiddle.net/hajtwbot/)
  * On an application being moved using Action, scroll to the section with moved application [Reference](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_element_scrollintoview.asp) 
  * Show additional info on hover (i.e. Hovering position title shows location, salary, etc..)
* ADD and EDIT forms
  * Hide the contact section until user selects yes [Reference](https://www.solodev.com/blog/web-design/how-to-hide-form-fields-based-upon-user-selection.stml)
  * Make it pretty in general [Reference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxRJ8vplzAo)

## Future Reach Goals:
* Mobile-friendly
* Company section pulls Glassdoor API information (ranking, locations, etc)
* Urges user to add 10 new applications a day
