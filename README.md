# Reach: A Job-hunt Assistant App

## v1.0 (2/24/20):
* Basic CRUD with Positions, moving positions to different areas given status updates

## To Do before Project Deadline:
* Add "Contact" Feature to New and Edit of Positions
* Simple stats in header (total applied)
* Fix bug where other users can see some other users' positions
* UI Changes
  * Round out each section's corners
  * Expand/collapse each section
* Hide certain info until hover (i.e. Position title only, then hover shows location, salary, etc..)
* On refresh from moving a position, flash that position for 5s and automatically scroll there
 
## Future Reach Goals:
* Mobile-friendly
* Company section pulls Glassdoor API information (ranking, locations, etc)
* Urges user to add 10 new applications a day
* Implement date-related "deadline" features
